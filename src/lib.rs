//! VirtIO guest drivers.
//!
//! These drivers can be used by bare-metal code (such as a bootloader or OS kernel) running in a VM
//! to interact with VirtIO devices provided by the VMM (such as QEMU or crosvm).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! You must first implement the [`Hal`] trait, to allocate DMA regions and translate between
//! physical addresses (as seen by devices) and virtual addresses (as seen by your program). You can
//! then construct the appropriate transport for the VirtIO device, e.g. for an MMIO device (perhaps
//! discovered from the device tree):
//!
//! ```
//! use core::ptr::NonNull;
//! use virtio_drivers::transport::mmio::{MmioTransport, VirtIOHeader};
//!
//! # fn example(mmio_device_address: usize) {
//! let header = NonNull::new(mmio_device_address as *mut VirtIOHeader).unwrap();
//! let transport = unsafe { MmioTransport::new(header) }.unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! You can then check what kind of VirtIO device it is and construct the appropriate driver:
//!
//! ```
//! # use virtio_drivers::Hal;
//! use virtio_drivers::{
//!     device::console::VirtIOConsole,
//!     transport::{mmio::MmioTransport, DeviceType, Transport},
//! };

//!
//! # fn example<HalImpl: Hal>(transport: MmioTransport) {
//! if transport.device_type() == DeviceType::Console {
//!     let mut console = VirtIOConsole::<HalImpl, _>::new(transport).unwrap();
//!     // Send a byte to the console.
//!     console.send(b'H').unwrap();
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
